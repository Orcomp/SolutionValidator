TODO: Replace this binary dependency as soon as new NuGet distrubution will be available which contains 
the new FormattingVisitor instead of the: 

[Obsolete("This class was replaced by CSharpFormatter.")]
public class AstFormattingVisitor {}

Important: Please do not be confused about the Assembly version. 
I left it intact: 5.0.0.0 however this version
is much more newer than the more than one year old NuGet distribution 5.3.0
